Product Requirement Document (PRD): Automated Employee Time-Off Management
Product Requirement Document (PRD): Automated Employee Time-Off Management

Introduction

Employees are entitled to 22 working days of Paid Time Off (PTO) annually. This project requires building an automated employee time-off management system using Airtable and Zapier. The goal is to streamline the submission, approval, and tracking of leave requests while keeping balances accurate and reducing manual effort.


Objectives

The system should:

Centralize employee, manager, and leave request data.
Automate notifications and approvals.
Keep employees informed of request status.
Update leave balances automatically, with balances resetting to 22 days at the start of each year.

Features

Time-Off Application
Employees should be able to submit requests with key details (dates, number of days, notes).
Manager Notification
Managers should be notified when an employee submits a request.
Approval Workflow
Managers should be able to approve or reject requests and provide optional comments.
Employee Notification
Employees should be notified of the approval or rejection of their request.
Leave Balance Management
Approved requests should deduct from the employeeâ€™s leave balance.
Leave balances should automatically reset to 22 days at the start of each year.

Implementation Requirements

Use Airtable as the database for all employee, manager, and request data.
Use Zapier and Airtable Automations to automate workflows, notifications, and leave balance updates.

Testing

The solution must be tested end-to-end to ensure:

Requests are captured correctly.
Notifications are sent at the right stages.
Approvals and rejections are processed correctly.
Leave balances update accurately.

Deliverables

Demo Video: Show the complete workflow from request submission to balance update.
Technical Documentation (Google Docs): Explain how Airtable and Zapier were set up and how future improvements can be made.
